----------------Overview-----------------------

The Library Seat Reservation System is a web-based platform designed to replace manual seat booking in libraries.
It helps students check seat availability, make reservations, and manage check-in/check-out, while admins can handle all reservations and seat management from one place.

------------Problem Statement--------------------

Many libraries still use manual methods for seat reservation, which causes:

Seats getting double-booked or left unused

Time wasted by staff and students during manual coordination

No real-time view of seat availability

No option for remote booking or changes

This project aims to remove these issues by providing a simple digital solution.
